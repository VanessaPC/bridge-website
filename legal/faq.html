         <h3>Frequent Asked Questions about Bridge</h3>

         <dl>
            <dt>What is the BRIDGE app?</dt>
            <dd>Bridge is a new highly secure mobile payment system*. Cyber security experts, PCI-DSS testing and major banks (inc High street) have approved our triple core security** system.</dd>
         </dl>

         <dl>
            <dt>What is Triple Core Security?</dt>
            <dd>The three core parts of our security are:</dd>
            <ul>
               <li>the customer application talks securely with the customers own bridge/bank server.</li>
               <li>the merchant application talks securely with the merchants own bridge/bank server.</li>
               <li>the entire system pass only tokens to allow the identification of the servers for the funds.</li>
            </ul>
            <dd>This means that no identifying or usable  information is passed between the customer, the merchant, and each other's banks.</dd>
         </dl>

         <dl>
            <dt>Why is Bridge Secure?</dt>
            <dd>Bridge uses a thin client Kerberos protected system, using SSL/HMAC which provides higher than current bank level security protocols protecting all
               communications in the system from decryption, theft and man in-the-middle attacks.<br />
               Once authentication with the banks is completed, any banking information is immediately removed from all parts of our system and all further actions are carried out using a set of tokens that can only be used by you on the Bridge system and mean nothing to anyone else. <br />
               Thus no financial information is stored anywhere in the Bridge System and no financial details are transferred when making a payment. Once registered, only you can make a payment, on your registered device and only with the registered payment method (Credit Card/Debit Card/Bank Account).

            </dd>
            </dl>



            <dl>
               <dt>How does BRIDGE work?</dt>
               <dd>BRIDGE is simple to use. To make payments, users securely link one or more bank accounts when signing up to the service. <br />

                  Once signed up users can generate secure transaction codes to make payments. <br />

                  When a secure transaction code has been generated the seller or recipient of funds scans or types in the code to confirm the sale or transfer of money. <br />

                  The user then receives a notification within the app to confirm the cost and accept the transaction.<br />

                  Upon acceptance, the transaction occurs behind the bank’s firewalls and security systems. Throughout this transaction no personal information has been exchanged or made available. <br />
               </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>What's so special about BRIDGE?</dt>
               <dd>BRIDGE is revolutionary in that it does not require users to give out any of their financial details. It is designed to remove all electronic attack methods and minimize social engineering attacks.
                  <br />
                  In a world where everybody is connected 24/7 through smart-phones and the Internet there is no need to exchange unnecessary information, especially important financial and personal information.
                  <br />
                  Because of this we created a security system that ensures the user’s financial information is protected at all times. In fact BRIDGE does not keep any of the users financial information at all.
                  <br />
                  BRIDGE users will never need to transmit any of their financial details. The system does not allow them to do so. Because of this users are not exposed to the risk of data theft, unlike payments through credit/debit card or any other online payment systems.
               </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>Why is BRIDGE safer than using a credit or debit card?</dt>
               <dd>Credit and debit cards are very insecure. Data can be stolen, “Phished” or hacked in many different ways. Currently, the number of these thefts is running at a rate of 600 million people’s data per year.
                  <br />
                  BRIDGE is the first payment method since the invention of the banknote to not require the person making a payment to reveal their personal financial information.
                  <br />
               </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>Who can use the app?</dt>

               <dd>Using higher than bank level security protocols and an open vertical server model, with thin client underlying Kerberos key handling system, as well as SSH (the basis of the internet), HiMAC encryption, your details are encrypted on the phone then passed by another level of encryption, to the server then passed to the bank to authenticate you once and are then completely removed from every part of the system.</dd>
               <dd>For example:</dd>
               <ul>
                  <li>At point-of-sale (in shops, bars, train stations etc.)</li>
                  <li>Online to merchants registered with BRIDGE</li>
                  <li>Person-to-person – (e.g. paying family or friends etc.)</li>
               </ul>
               <dd>Bridge will allow users to make payments both online and offline, face to face or on the web making it a versatile payment system with unrivalled capabilities. </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>How do I get the app?</dt>
               <dd>BRIDGE will be launched in early 2016 and will be available for download on the following systems:</dd>
               <ul>
                  <li>Apple (iOS)</li>
                  <li>Windows</li>
                  <li>Android</li>
               </ul>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>How much does the app cost?</dt>
               <dd>The App will be available to download for free from launch.</dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>How much does it cost to make transfers?</dt>
               <dd>Making payments with BRIDGE is free as there are no commissions or transfer fees taken during the process.</dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>
                  Are there any costs to receive payments on the app as a regular user?
               </dt>
               <dd>Using BRIDGE for personal transactions will be free for users under our fair usage policy. </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>What does it cost to receive payments with the app as a merchant?</dt>
               <dd>To receive commercial volumes of payments merchants must upgrade their version of the app to “Merchant” status.
                  <br />
                  To receive “Merchant” status a one off registration fee will be applied along with a monthly or annual charge for service costs.
                  <br />
                  As BRIDGE uses Bank-to-Bank transfers there are no commission payments for using the “Merchant” app therefore costs will be restricted to registration costs and a monthly/annual service fee.
                  <br />
                  BRIDGE also accepts credit and debit card payments, and as BRIDGE does not add on any fees, the transaction costs are far lower than those on any other payment system.
               </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>How do I install the app?</dt>
               <dd>To install BRIDGE, simply download the app and link one or more of your bank accounts to the system. You are then free to make payments to any other users or merchants who have downloaded the app. Additionally you can link, credit and/or debit cards to the app and pay BRIDGE merchants.</dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>How do I use the app to make payments?</dt>
               <dd>To make payments to other users or merchants, users must first log onto the app using their PIN. In order to initiate payments, users must generate a secure transaction code using the ‘pay’ function.
                  <br />
                  When a code is generated the seller or recipient scans the secure transaction code to link the devices. <br />
                  The user then receives a request to confirm the costs after the vendor has manually entered the value of the transaction / cost of goods. Upon acceptance, a transfer occurs behind the bank’s firewalls and security systems. Throughout this transaction no personal information has been exchanged.
               </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>How do I use the app to receive payments?</dt>
               <dd>After securely linking a bank account to bridge users are free to receive payments.
                  <br />
                  To receive payments simply scan or enter the unique transaction code on a payer’s device to confirm receipt of funds and link your devices.
                  <br />
                  Once both devices are linked an invoice is created to transmit the value of the transfer to the user making a payment.
                  <br />
                  The user making payment will then accept the value of the transfer allowing both banks involved to transfer money behind their firewalls and security system.
                  <br />
                  Only merchant enabled accounts can accept payments from credit and debit cards.
               </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>Do I need to pay for any special equipment or technology to use BRIDGE?</dt>
               <dd>No specialised equipment is needed to make payments with BRIDGE.
Users can download the app for free on their existing smartphones and other device.

               </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>What is the difference between BRIDGE and its competitors?</dt>
               <dd>BRIDGE uses a Comcarde’s new triple core security system to protect users’ data. This makes BRIDGE far safer than any other system on the market. </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>Why is BRIDGE safer than other mobile payment systems?</dt>
               <dd>Unlike other systems, BRIDGE does not require that users transmit personal financial data to third parties or to store it anywhere other than at their existing bank.
                  <br />
                  Rivals are claiming that their storage of such data will be exceptionally secure, but all systems can be cracked and we believe the safest way to prevent data being stolen is not to make it available in the first place.
                  <br />
                  Uniquely, using Comcarde’s patent pending technology, BRIDGE can make and receive payments whether it is connected to the Internet or not.

               </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>What happened to Target and why can't it happen to BRIDGE?</dt>
               <dd>70 million customers of the US Target retail chain had their credit and debt card details stolen when an air-conditioning sub-contractor was given access to Target's internal systems and was used as a vehicle for hacking.
                  <br />
                  By using BRIDGE to make payments, customers will be certain this cannot happen to them, as the retail chain and the BRIDGE servers will not hold any of their payment details in the first place!
               </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>What if my phone is stolen?</dt>
               <dd>Unlike other mobile payment systems, BRIDGE does not store any of your financial details and your provider will not have a link to your bank account. The only thing the thief will see is the BRIDGE app icon.
                  <br />
                  BRIDGE also requires a pin code to initiate payments. This adds another level of security. If a thief doesn’t know your passcode, they will not be able to open the app. Your only loss will be the phone itself.
                  <br />
                  Users also have the capability to remove all bank accounts from BRIDGE remotely, via a web interface. So if for any reason a thief can gain access buy guessing your pin code they still won’t be able to access bank accounts or make payments.
               </dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>When will BRIDGE be available in Scotland?</dt>
               <dd>BRIDGE will be launched towards the end of 2015, initially in Inverness followed by launches in Edinburgh, St Andrews and Glasgow. <br />
After these initial launches BRIDGE will be rolled out across the UK.
               </dd>
            </dl>


            <dl>
               <dt>Where will BRIDGE be usable in Scotland?</dt>
               <dd>Based on market research and expressions of interest received to date, we expect that BRIDGE will be usable at most retail and hospitality outlets in Inverness and the surrounding area after initial launch.</dd>
            </dl>

            <dl>
               <dt>Will I be able to use BRIDGE outside the Inverness area?</dt>
               <dd>Once BRIDGE is launched, the system will work regardless of your location. Users will be able to pay other users and merchants who have downloaded and enabled the app.
                  <br />
                  We will be rolling out BRIDGE across the UK from the end of 2015 into early 2016. From launch the number of physical merchants users will be able to pay using the app will increase gradually based on the BRIDGE’s geographic reach.
