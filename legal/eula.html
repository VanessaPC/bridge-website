<p>1.1 The terms of this Section A apply to the App including any updates or supplements to the App, unless they come with separate terms, in which case those terms apply.

</li>
</ul>
<p>12.3    All amounts and fees stated or referred to in this Agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(a)    shall be payable in pounds sterling;</p>
</li>
<li><p>(b)    are, subject to clause 24.4, non-cancellable and non-refundable;</p>
</li>
<li><p>(c)    are exclusive of value added tax, which shall be added to our invoice(s) at the appropriate rate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>YOUR LIABILITY</p>
<p>13.1    In the event that there is an authorised Transaction or any other unauthorised debit from your Payment Instrument you must tell us as soon as reasonably practicable. We will investigate the matter promptly and will provide your Payment Instrument Provider with such reasonable assistance as may be requested in relation to its investigation of the issue.</p>

</li>
<li><p>EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES</p>
<p>14.1    We do not warrant that your use of the Service will meet your requirements or that your use of the Service will be uninterrupted or error free.

<li><p>(c)    if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation or request; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>(d)    in order to protect the rights, property or safety of Comcarde Limited our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA </p>
<p>19.1    All personal information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. All Transactions are encrypted.
